Phase-1-Project
This repository is an analysis of aviation accident data from the National Transport and Safety Board.
This repository is part of my Phase 1 Project in Data Science.

The company I am working for is looking to expand into new business. Specifically, purchasing and operating aircraft for private and commercial use. However, they do not know the potential risks of the aircrafts.
The data has been analyzed and actionable insights provided for the company.

The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses
